### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I am Valency Dickson

---

Iâ€™m a self taught Front-End developer; I have an in-depth knowledge in the field of Website and Web App development in the Front End part, developing Responsive web design for mobile/tablet or any display resolution.

I'm always open to learn and try something new in Front-End development. Iâ€™m a fast learner, able to pick up new skills and juggle different projects and roles.
